# smileBack-Project
smileBack is an open source/hardware backPanel that helps you to have a good posture while you are sitting. 

Itâ€™s a back panel that has two main functions:

    It provides you lumbar support everywhere. This means that also it can transform every chair in an ergonomic one.
    It monitors your posture with sensors and it tells you when your posture is not correct
    It tells you when you should take a break.
